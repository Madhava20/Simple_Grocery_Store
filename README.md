- Product Catalog: Display a list of available grocery items with details such as name, price, and description.
- Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their cart, view their cart contents, and update or remove items.
- Checkout Process: Users can proceed to checkout, review their order, and provide shipping and payment information.

## Technologies Used

- PHP: Backend scripting language used for server-side logic.
- MySQL: Database management system for storing product and user data.
- HTML/CSS: Frontend for user interface and styling.
- JavaScript: Used for enhancing user interactions.
- GitHub: Version control and collaborative development.
